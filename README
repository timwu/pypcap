
Python pcap module
------------------

This is a simplified object-oriented Python wrapper for libpcap -
the current tcpdump.org version, and the WinPcap port for Windows.

example use:

>>> import pcap
>>> for ts, pkt in pcap.pcap():
...     print ts, `pkt`
... 

Building
--------

Just try 'make', and then 'make install'

If your libpcap installation is missing the pcap-int.h header, you
will need to build against a libpcap build directory. Modify the
CONFIG_ARGS in the Makefile to point to the location of your built
libpcap distribution, and try again.

See INSTALL file for more detailed build instructions.
