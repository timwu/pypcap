INSTALLATION NOTES

Dependencies
------------

Building pypcap requires the following:
- libpcap/winpcap with development headers
- a working C compiler + make
- pyrex


Generic build instructions
--------------------------

Unpack the sources. Enter the source directory and type:

    $ make
    $ make install

This will do the trick in most cases. If not, read on...


Testing the installation
------------------------

Fire up the Python shell and type:

    >>> import pcap
    >>> pcap.pcap().next()

As soon as a packet appears on the first (default) interface, a line similar
to the following one will appear:

    (1278540477.9454119, <read-only buffer ptr 0xb6a79046, size 178 at 0xb755b5c0>)

Congratulations! You now have a working pypcap installation.


Building under Linux
--------------------

You need to have the following packages installed (package names come from
Ubuntu/Debian; other distros use different conventions):

    - build-essential (compiler+make)
    - libpcap0.8 and libpcap0.8-dev
    - python-pyrex

Use the following commands to build and install pypcap:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install


Building under Windows
----------------------

The easiest way to build the module under Windows is with the MinGW compiler.
To build, install the following:

    - Pyrex from http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/
    - MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/
    - WinPcap Developer's Pack from http://www.winpcap.org/

Afterwards, edit (create if doesn't exist) the following file:

    C:\Python26\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg

and insert the following section:

    [build]
    compiler = mingw32

Unpack the module sources to c:\pypcap, and developer's pack to c:\wpdpack.
Edit the pypcap Makefile; uncomment the following line:

    CONFIG_ARGS = --with-pcap=..\\wpdpack

and change the line:

    pyrexc pcap.pyx

to read:

    $(PYTHON) c:\Python26\Scripts\pyrexc.py pcap.pyx

Afterwards, fire up the command line, navigate to the sources dir, and type:

    C:\pypcap> set PATH=%PATH%;c:\MinGW\bin;c:\Python26
    C:\pypcap> mingw32-make
    C:\pypcap> mingw32-make install

Pypcap should get installed to c:\Python26\lib\site-packages\pcap.pyd.
